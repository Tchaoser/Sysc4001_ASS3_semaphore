Halden and Sapthakeerthi did part 1, 2 and 3 together. 
  Part 1 - Halden coded while I helped on the side
         - The report itself was done by halden wile Sapthakeerthi worked on part 2
  Part 2- Sapthakeerthi did part 2a and 2b, then we as a group worked on c,d and e to finish the part
  Part 3- Sapthakeethi Worked on part 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 while halden worked on part 3.4 and 3.5- but we
        collaborated enough on that we probably had the same input on each of the parts
